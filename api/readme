Coding standard
===============

File Names
----------
All classes must contain a CV prefix (for CLSA Vis).  VTK classes would start with vtkCV, QT classes with QCV
and application classes with simply CV.

Line Lenghts
------------
No line should exceed 110 characters

Function (Round) Brackets
-------------------------
Control structure and function arguments are always separated by a single space and start/end with a space.
Also, there is never a space between the control structure or function name and opening round bracking.  For
instance:

MyFunction( arg1, arg2, arg3 );
if( test ) process(); // functions with no arguments don't need spaces

Curly Braces
------------
Curly braces are placed on separate lines (from code) and indented at the same level as their parent.  For
instance:

if( var < 10 )
{ // comments can go here
  for( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )
  {
    // do something here
  }
}
